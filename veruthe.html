Overview

Stranger Things is set in <br>
the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the 1980s. <br>
The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy but secretly experiments with the <br>
paranormal and supernatural, sometimes with human test subjects. They have inadvertently created a portal to an alternate dimension they refer to as the <br>
Upside Down, whose presence begins to affect the residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.

The first season begins in November 1983. Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down.<br> 
His mother, Joyce; the town's police chief, Jim Hopper; and a group of volunteers search for him. A young psychokinetic girl named Eleven escapes <br>
from the laboratory and is found by friends of Will. Eleven befriends and assists them in their efforts to find Will.[7]

The second season is<br> set a year later in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but he begins having premonitions of the fall of Hawkins caused by a<br> 
creature in the Upside Down. When it is discovered that Will is still being possessed by an entity from the Upside Down, his friends and family <br> 
learn that there is a larger threat to their world.[8]

The third season is set several months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July celebration in 1985.<br> 
The new Starcourt Mall<br> has become the center of attention for Hawkins residents, putting the majority of other local stores out of business <br>
due to the mall's popularity. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship and becomes very protective of his daughter. <br>
Unbeknownst to the town, a secret Soviet laboratory underneath Starcourt seeks to open the gateway to the Upside Down. Meanwhile, the Mind Flayer uses mind <br>
control to make Billy do his bidding.[9][10]

The fourth season is set several months later, in March 1986. Joyce, Will, Eleven, and Jonathan have moved to Lenora,<br>
 California for a fresh start.<br> In California, Eleven struggles with the loss of her powers and being bullied in school. Meanwhile, in Hawkins, <br>
a being from the Upside Down—an entity later dubbed Vecna—begins killing the residents of Hawkins, opening new gates between the two worlds in the process.<br>
 Planning to stop Vecna, Dr. Sam Owens takes Eleven to a facility to help her regain her powers. Simultaneously, Joyce and Murray fly to Russia
 to rescue Hopper from the Gulag in Kamchatka. </p></div>
